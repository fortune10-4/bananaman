    <p>
The Minions exist in a perfect, utilitarian, utopian society in which strength leads with a firm yet not cruel hand. The minions do not discriminate against one another for intelligence or physical prowess-all are equal in their society as long as they are fit to obey the commands of their leader, who, as we have seen, cannot and will not be another minion. This leads me to the lynchpin of my argument: man cannot lead man. Dog can lead man, and shark can lead man, but man can never lead man. We must find or create a being more powerful than we are so that we may reap the returns of the perfect utopia that is the society of the Minions. If we succeed, our ultimate paradise awaits. If not, we shall surely destroy ourselves or our planet. As such, it is up to us, the pivotal generation, to turn the tides, to study the Minions movie as if it were our bible, to adhere to each and every word and sound uttered in this absolute masterpiece. Only in doing this can we as a species realize our true potential, and rise above our evolutionary limitations.

    <p>I'm not sure how I can come out like this, or how to even fabricate my unorthodox emotions into words. But here goes; I am a minion.

        Every morning I meet up with my friends, and say "bello". The looks of despair I am greeted with mixed with the utmost disgust upsets me deeply. Just because I speak minionease.
        
        I look in the mirror and shed a tear as I wish I was 4 feet smaller, and had only 1 eye. Kevin, Stuart and even Bob to an extent have always been role models of mine due to how well they act and the humour they exhibit.
        
        Please don't be a hater and say that I am a troll punk, because even us minions have feelings too.</p>
